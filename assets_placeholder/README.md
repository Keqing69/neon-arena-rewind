## Optional Audio Assets

This project supports custom sound effects, but audio files are not included
in the repository due to licensing restrictions.

Add your own sounds locally and update `SOUND_CONFIG` in `neon_arena.py`.

Supported formats:
- .mp3
- .wav
- .ogg

Audio files are ignored by `.gitignore` and will not be committed.
